  MDSetup
</h1>
<p align="center">This repository enables users to perform molecular dynamics simulations utilizing LAMMPS or GROMACS. It can either start from given topology and coordinate file, or create them itself by using moleculegraph and supplementary Python code. YAML files are utilized to define simulation settings, such as ensemble definitions, sampling properties and system specific input.  </p>

## 🚀 Getting Started

Get started by running the following command to install:

1. MDSetup
```
git clone https://github.com/samirdarouich/MDSetup.git
cd MDSetup
pip install .
```

## 🐍 Example program

Examples are provided for the system building using the homebrew force field file format. Furthermore, notebooks to setup and analyse simple MD simulations in LAMMPS / GROMACS are provided.

Templates can be changed and expanded to specific needs.

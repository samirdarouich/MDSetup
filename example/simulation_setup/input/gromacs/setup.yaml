# fraction is computed with respect to first provided molecule.
# If one statepoint is not wanted comment it out

# Define the components
# In case of GROMACS add 'nrexcl', which defines the number
# of bonded interactions that are excluded for the molecule
# e.g.: nrexcl=3, means excluding bonded, angle and dihedral interactions
